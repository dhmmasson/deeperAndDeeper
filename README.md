Basic prototype V.1.0

*   you are a falling rectangle
*   you can rotate with keyboard left and right
*   you must go through holes in planes

that's it... there is a depth indicator on the top of the screen. You lose if you touch a border.
There is only two holes to go through right now.


In reality the plane are falling, camera and player are fixed.

# Ideas :
-   **visual effect** deeper and deeper = Hypnosis / trance => using [autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) ( magic image ) to put the player into a trance like state
-   **gameplay** one of this game where your piece fall through holes of various shape continuously and you have to navigate this vertical maze **deeper and deeper**
-   **visual effect** the magic texture goes from grass to deep soil
-   **Music** I have this descending music rift I have played for years that might be used to do a reverse **[Shepard tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone)**
