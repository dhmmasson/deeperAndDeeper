Basic game idea

*   you are a falling rectangle,
*   you can rotate with keyboard left and right
*   you must avoid two planes that are offset from the center.

that's it... there is a depth indicator on the top of the screen

In reality the plane are falling, camera and player are fixed.
Falling should be done at constant speed...
falling markers should be added 

# Ideas :
-   **visual effect** deeper and deeper = Hypnosis / trance => using [autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) ( magic image ) to put the player into a trance like state
-   **gameplay** one of this game where your piece fall through holes of various shape continuously and you have to navigate this vertical maze **deeper and deeper**
-   **visual effect** the magic texture goes from grass to deep soil
-   **Music** I have this descending music rift I have played for years that might be used to do a reverse **[Shepard tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone)**
